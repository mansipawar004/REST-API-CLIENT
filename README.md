DESCRIPTION : A REST API Client in Java is an application that connects to a public RESTful web service (API), sends HTTP requests (like GET or POST), retrieves the response (usually in JSON format), and processes or displays it in a structured way. These clients are commonly used to integrate external services such as weather data, currency exchange rates, or social media feeds into Java applications.
Purpose is the goal is to create a Java application that:
Sends a request to a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
Parses the JSON response.
Displays relevant data (like temperature, humidity, or weather description) in a user-friendly format.
1. HTTP Request Handling:
Uses classes such as HttpURLConnection, HttpClient, or libraries like OkHttp or Retrofit to send HTTP requests to a REST endpoint.
2. JSON Parsing:
Parses the response using libraries like org.json, Gson, or Jackson to extract specific values.
3. Data Display:
Outputs the extracted data (e.g., weather condition, temperature) in a readable format using the console or a GUI.
